## About

**Elixpo Open Source** is a multi-tenant platform for running complete
open-source contests, mentorship programs, campus initiatives, contribution
sprints, and long-running community programs. A host connects a GitHub
organization or selected repositories, defines a contest, invites the team,
and operates the full program from a role-aware workspace.

> This repository is the source for the official hosted platform at
> [opensource.elixpo.com](https://opensource.elixpo.com).

### Why Elixpo Open Source?

- **Complete contest lifecycle** — Configure applications, schedules, repositories, rules, reviews, results, and rewards for programs lasting weeks or months.
- **Every role included** — Give scoped workspaces to hosts, co-hosts, project admins, mentors, campus ambassadors, and contributors.
- **GitHub-native tracking** — Follow issues, claims, pull requests, reviews, merges, and repository activity without replacing GitHub.
- **Mentorship operations** — Manage review queues, mentees, office hours, check-ins, and recognition.
- **Fair gamification** — Build transparent points, badges, streaks, and leaderboards on an append-only ledger.
- **Auditable administration** — Record role changes, manual overrides, verification decisions, and reward approvals with an actor and reason.
- **Elixpo-managed essentials** — Use Elixpo Accounts for identity and connect to shared mail and payout services as those phases land.

## Product model

A host can create multiple contests and invite other hosts. Each contest owns
its schedule, repositories, roles, label rules, contribution activity,
leaderboards, and reward configuration.

| Role | Primary workspace responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Host owner / co-host** | Contest setup, organization access, team invitations, analytics, and rewards |
| **Project admin** | Repository configuration, issues, contribution verification, and rule enforcement |
| **Mentor** | Reviews, mentee support, office hours, check-ins, and justified bonus points |
| **Campus ambassador** | Campus onboarding, outreach activity, and participant support |
| **Contributor** | Issue discovery, claims, pull requests, points, rankings, and rewards |
| **Spectator** | Public contest pages, projects, profiles, and leaderboards |

## Project status

The platform is under active development. The current foundation includes:

- A responsive public landing page and role-aware host panel.
- Contest creation and workspace route foundations.
- Cloudflare Workers deployment through the OpenNext adapter.
- D1 schema and migrations for contests, memberships, repositories, activity, points, invitations, webhooks, and audits.
- KV bindings for disposable cache data and best-effort rate limiting.
- SOPS and age-based encrypted environment management.

Identity integration, GitHub App ingestion, complete role dashboards, and
production workflows are being delivered incrementally. Follow the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/elixpo/opensource/issues) for scoped work.

## Running this project locally

Requirements: Node.js 20 or newer, npm, and SOPS for shared secret management.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run cf:build
npm run cf:preview
```

## Cloudflare infrastructure

Production runs as a **Cloudflare Worker** through the OpenNext adapter.
**D1** is authoritative for contest and contribution state. **KV** is used only
for disposable cached views and best-effort rate-limit counters because KV is
eventually consistent.

| Binding | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `DB` | Contests, memberships, repositories, contributions, points, invitations, webhooks, and audits |
| `CACHE` | Disposable dashboard and computed-view caches |
| `RATE_LIMITS` | Best-effort request quotas; never authorization or reward state |
| `ASSETS` | OpenNext static assets |

Provision the resources once and replace the placeholder IDs in
[`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc):

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create opensource-elixpo
npx wrangler kv namespace create CACHE
npx wrangler kv namespace create RATE_LIMITS
npm run cf:typegen
```

Manage the versioned D1 schema with:

```bash
npm run db:migrations:list:local
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run db:migrations:list:remote
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

Remote migrations run before the Worker deployment in the manually triggered,
protected `Deploy Cloudflare Worker` GitHub Actions workflow.

## Environment and SOPS

- `.env.example` documents expected application variables.
- `.env.local` contains plaintext developer values and is ignored by Git.
- `.env` is the committed SOPS-encrypted shared environment file.
- `.sops.yaml` contains public age recipients; private keys never enter the repository.

```bash
npm run env:decrypt   # .env -> .env.local
npm run env:encrypt   # .env.local -> .env
```

Wrangler commands disable automatic `.env` loading so SOPS ciphertext cannot
become Worker bindings. Runtime secrets are declared in `wrangler.jsonc` and
uploaded to Cloudflare separately.

## Architecture

The web application runs on Cloudflare Workers. D1 stores authoritative state,
KV supports cache and rate limiting, Elixpo Accounts provides identity, and a
GitHub App supplies repository activity.
